### Abstract
`animint2` is an R library that allows you to create interactive and animated multi-layer, multi-plot data visualizations designed with ggplot2. `animint2` renders using javascript library D3.js. It helps in understanding patterns in large and multi-variate datasets. The aim of the project was to document, render, debugging upon the already exsiting `animint2` which the latest version of `animint`

### Introduction
The initial motive behind this GSoC project was to translate Animint Designer Manual to animint2 code, and create additional chapters to further document animint2 usage. The objective was to compile a designer manual for animint2 package that will outline different function, resolve issues and guide user to the package. So far there was no proper equivalent documentation to animint2. This was to be the official documentation on animint2 package of R Language.

The `ggplot2` dependency has been a major issue as `animint2` is dependent on it. Further work done by past contributors reduced the dependency which resulted in two separate packages `ggplot2Animint` and `animint2`. `ggplot2Animint` is `animint2` specific package used to support the changes needed which were not accepted earlier. As we moved long in the project, movtive changed to continue the work on `animint2` done by fellow contributors and make package ready for CRAN submissions.
